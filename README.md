# Original Notes

The original repository is from: [https://github.com/swcai/iphone-png-normalizer](https://github.com/swcai/iphone-png-normalizer).

To quote,

> The PNG file format inside iPhone application is slightly different from
> normal PNG files. So when you get the png images from iphone app package,
> you should make some conversion.

> I wrote this handy Ruby script to do it for me. Let me know if you think
> it is useful.

## Fork Notes

I found it super useful! I added a slight layer to make it useful (as a replacement for pngcrush w/
minimal options) on a linux system. Huzzah for Open Source!
